## Machine Learning Models

This is my code repository for various Machine Learning Algorithms. Those are namely **Linear Regression,Logistic Regression,K-Nearest Neighbour,Naive Bayes**. Links to actual Jupyter Notebooks are given below.

>- **Mini Batch SGD** has been implemented using **python NumPy,Pandas** libraries and tested on Boston House Prices dataset. Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/schirmerchad/bostonhoustingmlnd)
>- Other Algorithms have been applied to **Amazon Food Review** dataset for sentiment analysis. Dataset can be fetched from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews). Used **python Sklearn** library along with **Matplotlib,NumPy,Pandas** etc.
>- One Exploratory Data Analysis example is added. Dataset used is [Habermn Cancer Survival](https://www.kaggle.com/gilsousa/habermans-survival-data-set) Dataset.
